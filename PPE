### Personal Protection Equipment

### So you're caring for someone with Covid

Where possible, follow the guidance from public health authorities. Recent guidance from [WHO](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-guidance-wearing-and-removing-personal-protective-equipment-healthcare-settings-updated.pdf), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) includes the following: 

* **Medical mask, preferably N95** (20-30 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085H6Y6HN/ref=sr_1_22?keywords=n95&qid=1584011653&sr=8-22))

FFP2 or FFP3 respirators (valved or non-valved versions) are also recommended. A regular face mask (surgical or procedural) is better than nothing if you cannot get a respirator. 

You will want to put on the respirator / mask before entering the patient's room. 

* **Gown** (5 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00FRGIS56/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=medizinischer+Schutzkittel&qid=1584012077&sr=8-5))

Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown. 

* **Gloves** (10-15 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3J837JBVX0LC4&keywords=handschuhe+schutz&qid=1584011916&sprefix=gloves%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-8))

* **Eye protection, goggles or face shield** (4 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002THV25Y/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=augenschutz&qid=1584011828&sr=8-5))


This is the recommended level of protection for people providing direct care or assistance to a Covid patient at home. It may be worth following it in particular if you are in a more vulnerable group (e.g., older and / or with existing medical conditions), and / or if it simply makes sense to spread out infections in your household (e.g., if you are the sole carer for someone else, and it's better for you to not be sick at the same time). 

Don't just assume you're going to get it and might as well be exposed. Although risk is stratified, especially by age and health condition, it is possible for healthy young people to become severely ill with Covid. 

Continue to exercise appropriate caution and employ PPE and / or social distancing measures when possible, even with people for whom you are caring. The viral shedding period for Covid seems to be [between 8 and 37 days](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext). So it may make sense to wear PPE when you need to care for people who may or do have Covid in person, and then use social distancing to limit in-person contact with them for a while when they are able again to care for themselves. 

Putting on and taking off PPE correctly is also important.
