## Level 3 -- Bedridden

All the good care in Level 2 has not worked and things are getting worse. Doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just keep going. Except now the patient is getting weaker. He or she is often too weak to get out of bed and may need extra encouragement to eat and drink. 

### If the patient is you

This is when you start telling other people around you that you are really ill and are mostly in bed. Talk to someone you trust about how they may have to take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If you have people in your environment who have already had Covid (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make the best caregivers as they presumably will be Covid-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in your circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because being short of breath can also affect your ability to talk and think clearly.

### In any case

* Stay in bed. At this point rest is very important. The patient should sleep as much as possible. At least in the beginning, patients will still be able to get out of bed for limited amounts of time. Toilet, a quick rinse-off shower, weighing once a day (note in diary). Put new sheets on the bed as often as possible and wash the old sheets at 60 degrees Celsius or warmer.
* Ventilate the room as often as possible
* Drink more water! (more than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day)
* Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok (need: a couple of tubes of these big fizzy multi-vitamin pills for in a glass of water)
* Inhale more often 

At this point, read carefully all the signs that indicate Level 4. The purpose of care in Level 3 is to monitor the patient more and more closely so as to catch early any signs that the patient is moving to Level 4. For instance: If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day, you should insist. Dehydration is a risk, and if the patient is really unable to drink 2 liters a day you're quickly in Level 4. In most cases however the patient will get better after a few days. Just stay with it.
