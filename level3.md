## Level 3 -- Bedridden

All the good care in Level 2 has not worked and things are getting worse. Doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just keep going. Except now the patient is getting weaker. He or she is often too weak to get out of bed and may need extra encouragement to eat and drink. 

### If the patient is you

This is when you start telling other people around you that you are really ill and are mostly in bed. Talk to someone you trust about how they may have to take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If you have people in your environment who have already had Covid (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make the best caregivers as they presumably will be Covid-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in your circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because being short of breath can also affect your ability to talk and think clearly.

### In any case

* Stay in bed
* Ventilate the room as often as possible
* Drink more water! (more than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day)
* Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok (need: a couple of tubes of these big fizzy multi-vitamin pills for in a glass of water)
* Inhale more often 

If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day, then you may want to ask if he or she would like to try receiving subcutaneous fluids (see below). Preventing severe dehydration can help prevent other complications. Severe dehydration should be treated by medical professionals in a hospital environment. Signs of dehydration include dark or no urine, dizziness and fainting, rapid respiration and heart rate, lack of energy, and changes in mental or emotional state.
