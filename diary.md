## COVID-19 diary

We have created an example of what a dialy page in your COVID diary could look like. It looks a lot like the information they keep about patients in hospitals. It may seem a bit overengineered, but it allows you to keep track of how someone is doing and then (if you need to see a doctor or go to hospital) hand over data in a format that doctors like to read. Simply print one of these these for every day that the patient is sick. Since you don't want to find out you're out of printer paper in the middle of this, maybe print out 20-30 of these as part of your preparation. Don't worry if you don't have equipment to do all these measurements. (Although it is pretty cheap to get and it really doesn't hurt to have, see the [shopping page](/shopping).

### Starting the diary

You probably want to take a look at this and keep the data in this format even if the patient is just developing symptoms. It doesn't matter if you don'f fill in most of the data or dont fill it in often, but this is actually a good time to get a feel for what - more or less - normal values look like. As the patient is in bed and possibly has other people taking care of him or her, you can take measurements a bit more often.
