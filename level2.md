## Level 2 -- Emerging Symptoms

Notice if you suffer from any of the following symptoms:

* Dry cough
* Fever
* Shortness of breath
* Coughing up slime
* Fatigue

Is COVID-19 spread in the community where you live? Or have you been to an affected area or been around someone who was in an affected area? Then your symptoms could very well be COVID-19. But remember: In many areas, the odds that it's something else will still be greater.

> Note: Fever is not subjective. You will need a thermometer (or two), and to keep track in a log of at least daily temperature. If you choose to take temperature rectally (i.e., in the ass), it will be more precise. Be sure you have enough wipes and alcohol to clean the thermometer after each use. If taking temperature orally, donâ€™t eat or drink for 20 minutes beforehand. Either way, note the method in your log so healthcare personnel know which it is. (Around .7 degrees Celsius is often added to oral temperatures.) 

### Diagnosis

There will be different policies surrounding testing for COVID-19 based on where you are and what stage of the pandemic your area is in. Check online, call official hotline numbers, follow official guidelines, and consider driving to a drive-through testing center if your area has one and the patient qualifies for testing. **You should not just show up at a doctor's office or a hospital unannounced if you just experience the first symptoms.**

> Remember: Hospitals are bad places to be until you absolutely have to be there: You and / or the patient run the risk of getting additional infections that, when bacterial or fungal, are much more likely to be resistant to standard treatments due to the nature of the hospital environment. Also: Many hospitals are going to be overloaded.

### Don't Panic - The Worried Well

For most people, this will be as bad as it gets. You'll be a little sick, and then you'll get better. Done. At the same time, some people will not be so lucky. Even if only a relatively small percentage of those affected need medical care, this will put a serious strain on doctors, nurses and available medical resources. We can all help. The "Worried Well" are people who visit the doctor when they are not really (all that) sick, because they need reassurance. The coming weeks and months are not a good time for that. This website aims to give you more confidence and preparedness in caring for yourself, friends, and loved ones until you / they actually need professional help.

### Self-quarantine

Until tested and depending on where you are and where you have been, it may be prudent to assume the patient (you? a family member?) has COVID-19. That means self-quarantine at home. No more visitors, a sign on the door, and the patient should not go out unless there is no chance of meeting anyone. Different areas have different standards for what it means to self-quarantine when there are other people in the household. If possible, you will want to err on the side of safety and try to get everything delivered for 2 weeks. Things may change, as in some areas the virus will become so common (endemic) that many people will have had it. There is no telling at what point various authorities will stop testing every potential infection, and it will differ from region to region.

### Family, flatmates, etc.

Household members of people who are known or suspected to be infected should treat themselves as potentially also infected and self-quarantine too, while keeping the maximum practicable distance from the patient for as long as the patient can take care of him- or herself. Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces with household bleach diluted with water: 10 ml / 2 tsp bleach with half a liter / 2 cups of water (carefully washing measurement tools before reuse). You can put that solution in a disused plant sprayer or cleaner spray bottle. You should give the spray a minute to work on surfaces before wiping it dry.

Now at the latest is time to think about Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). If you can get masks and haven't been sick yet, it is probably a good idea to wear one. Disposable gloves, long-sleeve protective gowns, and eye protection may also be appropriate. The [shopping page](/shopping) on this website contains some ideas for personal protection items.

In most places, there will probably come a time when the number of cases skyrockets, many people have already had COVID-19, and authorities will no longer keep records of who has had it and who hasn't. The basis then remain the same: Try to protect older people and people with existing illnesses as much as possible, and try to minimize spread whenever you can, as best you can. Remember: The more we can slow down the disease's spread, the better it is for everyone. Because by slowing the spread (i.e., flattening a potentially exponential curve), you can help lessen how overwhelmed the healthcare system is going to become. That in turn increases the proportion and number of people who need medical care, who are able to access it. This helps doctors and nurses save more lives. 

### Diary

When symptoms first start is the right time to start an illness diary. 

A few times a day, preferably at somewhat regular hours or points in your normal routines or rhythms (e.g., every morning before making coffee or tea), measure temperature, even if you don't feel like you have a fever (yet). Weigh once a day if possible. Also note respiratory and heart rates in breaths and beats per minute. It will get you used to doing these things, give you practise, and (if you start early) give you some idea what (more or less) healthy values for you look like. Not necessary, but extra points for blood pressure and oxygenation (Devices to measure those are cheap, see the [shopping page](/shopping)). 

Then write down any symptoms the patient has. If he or she is in pain, where and when is the pain, and how bad on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)? How bad is the cough? What color if there is mucus being produced? Be sure to note what medication, if any, the patient takes. Paracetamol is a good choice for fever and pain suppression. Keeping an illness diary will also help you to keep track of how much you've taken, when, to ensure you treat fever adequately without taking more than the recommended amount in a 24-hour period. 

#### Printable illness diary

We made a **printable [illness diary](/images/covid-diary.pdf)** that you can use to write down all the information you collect when you take temperature, breathing rate, etc. If you like, you can print one of these forms for each day and keep them with the patient in case things get worse and you need to go to hospital.

If you make your own illness diary instead, keep in mind it's better to keep it physical rather than electronic. This protects your medical data better from a privacy perspective. It also makes it easier to take the diary in to a doctor's office or hospital. To start the illness diary if you want to make your own instead of printing the form, you might take a sheet of blank computer paper or legal pad and turn it lengthwise (i.e., landscape-orient it). Write the fields you want to track on the left in the first column header. Write the first day's date at the top in the first row header. Then just fill it out as you go. 

Columns should include: 
- daily weight
- temperature and time
- fever medication: drug, dose, time(s)
- other medications: same
- pain: where, when, how bad it is from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)
- coughing: does it hurt, is it productive, wet or dry, frequent or occasional, does it interfere with sleep?
- mucus: what color, how much?
- breathing: is it labored when you're doing nothing, or when you exert yourself? If shortness of breath bothers you, maybe start noting respiration rate in breaths per minute. 

### Get healthy again

Treat pain and fever with over-the-counter medication of your preference (e.g., paracetamol) at the recommended safe dosages; getting in and out of the bath or shower can also help lower body temperature (even when the water temperature is comfortable). Try to keep eating nutritious food. Nothing too heavy, not too much at the same time. Lots of vitamins and fresh produce. Adequate carbohydrates (potatoes, rice, pasta, etc). Inhale steam 3+ times a day. Go for a daily walk when possible, while keeping distance from other people. If your throat is irritated, avoid acidic drinks (such as soda and juice) as they can be further irritating; water and herbal teas are better choices then. If your mucus (slime) production is high, consider avoiding dairy as it can increase mucus production; avoiding dairy, excessive salt intake, and nitrates (which are used in most cold cuts / deli meats) is also recommended for people with lung disease. If you want to try to suppress your cough enough to get a good night's sleep so your body can better heal itself, over-the-counter cough medications, herbal teas such as anise / chamomile, cocoa, and lozenges can help. Some over-the-counter cough medications contain ingredients like guaifenesin or NAC, mucolytics that relieve coughing by helping your body get rid of mucus (usually by making it thinner and so easier to cough up); your pharmacist can help you find one that's right for you. 

### Feeling better?

Before you break your quarantine, health authorities may want to (re)test you to see you are really not contagious anymore. But maybe the number of cases is already so high that people will have to make their own decisions. Err on the side of safety and try to stay home for a little longer than officially indicated. 

If you managed to get tested, yay! You now know that your body (presumably, keep watching the latest science on this) has built immunity. Which means that this thing is over for you, and also that you are a more logical choice to help your family and friends when they get sick. Depending on what state the world is in, you may want to inform your employer and others that might depend on you that you've had it, so they know you're immune.
