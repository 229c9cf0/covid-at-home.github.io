## Level 2 -- Emerging Symptoms
 
* Cough ?
* Fever ?
* Shortness of breath ?

Well, if it appears in the next weeks and months, it could very well be Covid. (But in many areas the odds that it's something else will still be greater for a while.)

### Diagnosis

> Note: Fever is not subjective. You will need a thermometer (or two), and to keep track in a log of at least daily temperature. If you choose to take temperature rectally (i.e. in the ass) it will be more precise. Be sure you have enough wipes and alcohol to clean the thermometer after use. If taking temperature orally, don’t eat or drink for 20 minutes beforehand. Either way, note the method in your log so healthcare personnel know which it is. (Around .7 degrees Celsius is often added to oral temperatures.) 

There will be different policies surrounding testing based on where you are and what stage of the pandemic that area is in. Follow official guidelines, and consider driving to a drive-through testing center if your area has one and the patient qualifies for testing. Under no circumstances should you show up at a doctor's office or hospital unannounced. Hospitals are bad places to be unless you absolutely have to be there: you and/or the patient run the risk of getting additional infections that are more likely to be resistant due to the nature of the hospital environment. 

### Don't panic

For most people, this will be as bad as it gets. You'll be sick, and then you'll get better. Done.

### Self-quarantine

Until tested, assume the patient (you? a family member?) has Covid. That means you are now in self-quarantine at home. No more visitors, a sign on the door (e.g., "Please stop; Covid is here"), and the patient should not go out unless there is no chance of meeting anyone. Different areas have different standards for what it means to self-quarantine when there are other people in the household. You will want to err on the side of safety and try to get everything delivered for 2 weeks. 

### Family, flatmates, etc

Household members should treat themselves as potentially infected and stay at home too, while keeping the maximum practicable distance from the patient for as long as the patient can take care of him- or herself. Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces, and then clean again with household bleach water diluted with water (10 ml bleach with .5 liters water to disinfect surfaces that may have been contaminated with secretions). This is a time to begin thinking about PPE, or Personal Protection Equipment. This website will contain a special section on PPE soon.

It's important to realise that thinking about protection is very dependent on context. If you can get masks and you haven't been sick yet, it is probably a good idea to wear one. If there is a limited number of cases in your area/region, you probably need to get tested and your health authorities will have rules for your quarantine. These rules supersede this document, just do as they say.

In most places there will probably come a time when the number of cases skyrockets, many people have already had Covid and authorities will no longer keep records of who has had it and who hasn't. If you have to make decisions on your own, try to protect older people and people with existing illnesses as much as possible, and try to minimize spread whereever you can, best you can. The more we slow the disease down, the better it is for everyone.

### Diary

It's time to start an illness diary. A few times a day, preferably at regular hours, measure temperature. Weigh the patient once a day if possible. Also note respiratory and heart rates in breaths and beats per minute. Not necessary, but extra points for blood pressure and oxygenation (see below). Write down what symptoms the patient has. If he or she is in pain, where and when is the pain, and how bad on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)? How bad is the cough? What color if there is mucus being produced? And be sure to note what medication, if any, the patient takes. Paracetamol is a good choice for painkilling and fever supression. Keeping an illness diary will also help you to keep track of how much you've taken, when, to ensure you treat fever adequately without taking more than recommended amount in a 24-hour period. 

### Get healthy again

Treat fever with over-the-counter medication of your preference (e.g., paracetamol) at the recommended safe dosages; getting in and out of the bath or shower can also help lower body temperature (even when the water temperature is comfortable). Try to keep eating nutritious food. Nothing too heavy, not too much at the same time. Lots of vitamins and fresh produce. Adequate carbohydrates. Inhale steam 3+ times a day. Go for a daily walk when possible, while keeping distance from other people. If your throat is irritated, avoid acidic drinks (such as soda and juice) as they can be further irritating; water and herbal teas are better choices then. If your mucus production is high, consider avoiding dairy as it can increase mucus production; avoiding dairy, excessive salt intake, and nitrates (which are used in most cold cuts / deli meats) is also recommended for people with lung disease. If you want to try to suppress your cough enough to get a good night's sleep so your body can better heal itself, over-the-counter cough medications, herbal teas such as anise / chamomile, cocoa, and lozenges can help. Some over-the-counter cough medications contain ingredients like guaifenesin or NAC, mucolytics that relieve coughing by helping your body get rid of mucus (usually by making it thinner and so easier to cough up); your pharmacist can help you find one that's right for you. 


### Feeling better?

Before you break your quarantine, health authorities may want to (re)test you to see you are really not contagious anymore. But maybe the number of cases is already so high that people will have to make their own decisions. Err on the side of safety and try to stay home for a little longer than officially indicated. 

If you managed to get tested, yay! You now know that your body (presumably, keep watching the latest science on this) has built immunity. Which means that this thing is over for you, and also that you are a more logical choice to help your family and friends when they get sick. Depending on what state the world is in, you may want to inform your employer and others that might depend on you that you've had it, so they know you're immune.
