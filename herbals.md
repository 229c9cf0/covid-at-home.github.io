## Herbals 

This is a list of herbal / alternative medicine preparations to improve immunity and in some cases prevent and treat viral infections. As mentioned on the main page, there are a number of possibly useful preparations, but the evidence so far is specific to different contexts. A lot of snake-oil salesmen are going to make a lot of money off of panic here without offering actual help. Don't fall for them. Here is a list of some possibly helpful preparations with credible research behind them and citations thereof; your mileage may vary.

* [Quercetin](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/02/26/quercetin-for-flu.aspx), an antioxidant, protects against viral infections. 
* [Elderberry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), a natural source of quercetin, found in various preparations (e.g., [Sambucol](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B005039D78/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=sambucol&qid=1584023224&sr=8-8)).
* [Bovine colostrum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), cows' early milk, confers immune benefits from its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds, including immune and antimicrobial factors.
* [Probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), live microorganisms found as supplements or in fermented foods like yogurt, may reduce the risk, severity, and duration of upper respiratory tract infections. 
* [NAC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937299/), an antioxidant, may prevent and delay ventilator-assisted pneumonia. It also [decreases duration of ICU stay](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590037/) for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It [may or may not help against severe influenza](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5801167/). It has the same general mechanism as quercetin (anti-inflammatory), but also has mucolytic action (helps decrease and thin mucus).
