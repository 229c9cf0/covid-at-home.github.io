## Herbals 

This is a list of herbal / alternative medicine preparations to improve immunity and in some cases prevent and treat viral infections. Everything listed here has some scientific evidentiary basis with appropriate citations, and has a good safety profile (i.e., side effects are rare and not serious). Read the literature, use your best judgment, and prioritize common sense lifestyle approaches like eating nutritious, fresh foods, drinking plenty of water, and taking enough rest above any particular special sauce. 

* [Quercetin](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/02/26/quercetin-for-flu.aspx), an antioxidant, protects against viral infections. 
* [Elderberry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), a natural source of quercetin, found in various preparations (e.g., [Sambucol](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B005039D78/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=sambucol&qid=1584023224&sr=8-8)).
* [Bovine colostrum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), cows' early milk, confers immune benefits from its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds, including immune and antimicrobial factors.
* [Probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124954/), live microorganisms found as supplements or in fermented foods like yogurt, may reduce the risk, severity, and duration of upper respiratory tract infections. 
* [NAC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937299/), an antioxidant, may prevent and delay ventilator-assisted pneumonia. It also [decreases duration of ICU stay](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590037/) for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It [may or may not help against severe influenza](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5801167/). It has the same general mechanism as quercetin (anti-inflammatory), but also has mucolytic action (helps thin mucus) that make it particularly useful in patients with lung disease (like [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245155/)). 
* [Guaifenesin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724298/), another muco-active substance and common cough syrup ingredient, helps thin mucus to speed healing in acute upper respiratory tract infections as well as chronic sinusitis / bronchitis.
