## Level 1 -- Healthy

### Don't Get Infected

Where possible, follow the instructions from authorities. This includes some of the by-now familiar guidelines for social distancing:

* Change greeting. Instead of a handshake, hug, or kiss(es), try waving or bowing from a distance.
* Your eyes, nose, and mouth are possible ways for the virus to enter your body. Wash your hands before touching your face. Don't touch your face while outside.
* If you have to touch something, try fidgeting with a rubber band around your wrist or some other replacement behavior. 
* Wash hands with soap as often as possible, including as soon as you come home and before eating. 
* Regularly sterilize doorknobs, table surfaces, keyboards, and other places people frequently touch.
* Cough and sneeze into your elbow, not into your hand or unprotected. 
* Work from home when possible.
* Use alternatives to in-person meetings (e.g., video or voice calls) when possible. 
* Avoid crowds and unnecessary travel. 
* Instead of taking public transit, walk or bike wherever you can.
* Instead of going to restaurants, cook and eat at home. 
* Instead of meeting friends for a coffee or a drink, have a video-chat or coordinate a walk to the grocery store while keeping your safe distance of one meter or a little over 3 feet apart. 
* Follow any additional government advice, including the eventual advice to stay indoors when that becomes applicable for where you are.
* Try to be wary of "alternative facts". COVID-19 is real. It's a virus from nature, its effects on the world as a whole will not be "just like the flu," nor will it spell the end of civilisation. Some of the authors of this website are not known as great fans of government and authority, but at this point trust in the public health authorities is neccesary. Where there are discrepancies, trust reputable sources such as:
   * [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)
   * [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (USA)
   * [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html) (Germany)

Remember that there is no difference in potential infectiousness between friends and strangers. Try to help others when you can without being in contact with large groups of people unnecessarily. There are obvious trade-offs here that everyone has to weigh for themselves. Some people will need to have more contact with other people than others. Slowing the spread is never absolute, but over all of society still works when everyone does what they can, within their limits.

### Stay Healthy

On top of this, you can do things to stay as healthy as possible: 

* Breathe fresh air as often as possible.
* Ventilate your rooms frequently.
* Eat appropriate amounts of nutrient-rich, healthy food. Include at least some carbo-hydrates (potatoes, pasta, rice, etc). Vitamins D ("the sunshine vitamin") and C can be especially helpful in preventing or mitigating the effects of respiratory infections. 
* Drink enough.
* Get regular exercise.
* If you smoke, stop smoking.
* Avoid heavy drinking and other drug use, as alcohol and other drugs tend to suppress immmune function.

### Prepare

And on top of that, you can prepare so that you are familiar with the things that you will need to do when disease comes knocking. Read the rest of this guide. It is statistically unlikely anyone in your household will develop life-threatening complications, and hopefully there will be plenty of medical care for everyone. It doesn't hurt to be a tiny bit more ready for the worst-case scenario. But remember at the same time that there is no reason to panic, take a deep breath, and continue your regular life as much as possible.

#### Get the things you need

We made a [shopping page](https://www.covid-at-home.info/shopping) that lists handy things that help you care for yourself and others.

### Existing Medical Conditions

If you or your loved ones have existing medical conditions, now is the time to read up on how these conditions could be made worse by COVID-19 / pneumonia. You / they should make extra sure they have plenty of all the necessary medication (see Supplies). Make sure you have all the information relevant for treatment (contact info of doctors, recent lab results, how much of which drugs the patient is taking). Assume for a moment that your regular doctor isn't there and you have to explain it all to a new doctor who has very little time. A recent timeline of visits, results, etc would be nice. What should you not forget? Write it down now!

What sorts of existing medical conditions are especially likely to make you / your loved ones vulnerable to more severe COVID-19 problems?
- Conditions that involve lungs / breathing problems (e.g., asthma, COPD).
- Conditions that involve poor blood clotting, or that require taking blood thinners or immunosuppressant medications.
-  Other chronic hematologic, metabolic, neurologic, neuromuscular, cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disorders (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, congestive heart failure, kidney disease). 

During pandemics, it is typical for childhood immunizations, maternal healthcare, and healthcare for chronic health conditions to suffer because doctors, nurses, hospital systems, and the rest of the healthcare system may be overloaded, and because people may be afraid to go in to doctors' offices or hospitals for fear (sometimes rational) of being exposed to disease. In case your area is not greatly affected by COVID-19 yet: Is there any normal childhood vaccination you want to be sure your child gets while he or she can? Any prenatal care or routine care for a chronic health condition you can get now instead of in a month? What about other conditions that are common ailments for you or your loved ones? Anything you can do to prepare to care for yourselves without normal medical care access in the coming months, in case it becomes harder to get time with doctors and nurses because they are overwhelmed?
