# Covid @ Home

a guide for caring for Covid-19 patients at home

This document was made as a result of the Covid pandemic, but much of the advice is probably applicable in other situations. Much of what's discussed here may be common sense to some, but we felt it's still good to have some checklists and advice for various stages of the pandemic in one place. 

As we write this in Berlin, Germany in mid March 2020, much about the virus is still unclear, but numbers of infected and dead have been rising steadily, most recently in Italy. While it is not - ever - time to panic, it is time to think and prepare.

This guide assumes that in the coming months and years, more people than usual will either become ill or have ill people in their lives. Let's all hope for the best, but we're going to assume that hospitals are going to be very busy if not overloaded. We have to confront that it is possible or even likely that some of the people that would normally be cared for in a medical setting, or under some form of medical supervision will need to be cared for at home. 

WARNING: This document at present is a work in progress and should at this time only be used as inspiratioon for further thinking. Things are going to be incomplete or even wrong as we work with experts to make it better.

## Level 1 -- Healthy

### Don't Get Infected

Where possible, follow the instructions from authorities. This includes the by-now familiar guidelines for social distancing:

* Change greeting. Instead of a handshake, hug, or kiss(es), try waving or bowing from a distance.
* Keep mucus membranes clean. Instead of touching your face without first washing your hands, try fidgeting with a rubber band around your wrist. 
* Wash hands with soap as often as possible
* Regularly sterilize doorknobs, table surfaces, keyboards and other places where people touch.
* Cough and sneeze into your elbow, not into your hand or unprotected. 
* Work from home when possible.
* Use alternatives to in-person meetings (e.g., video or voice calls) when possible. 
* Avoid crowds. 
* Instead of taking public transit, walk or bike wherever you can. 


 
Remember that there is no difference in potential infectiousness between friends and strangers. Try to help others where you can without being in contact with large groups of people unnecessarily. There are obvious trade-offs here that everyone has to weigh for themselves. Some people will need to have more contacts with other people than other people. Slowing the spread is never absolute, but still works when everyone does what they can, within their limits.

### Stay Healthy

On top of this, you can do things to stay as healthy as possible: 

* Breathe fresh air as often as possible.
* Ventilate your rooms frequently.
* Eat appropriate amounts of vitamin-rich healthy food. Vitamins D ("the sunshine vitamin") and C can be especially helpful in preventing or mitigating the effects of respiratory infections. Adequate carbohydrate intake is also important. 
* Get regular exercise.
* Stop smoking (see below).

### Prepare

And on top of that you can prepare so that you are familiar with the things that you will need to do when disease comes knocking. Read the rest of this guide and note and obtain any easy-to-get items that you do not have lying around. It is unlikely anyone in your household will develop life-threatening complications, and hopefully there will be plenty of medical care for everyone. It doesn't hurt to be a tiny bit more ready for the worst-case scenario. But remember at the same time that there is no reason to panic, take a deep breath and also continue your regular life as much as possible.

### Existing Medical Conditions

If you or your loved ones have existing medical conditions, now is the time to read up on how these conditions could be made worse by Covid / pneumonia. People with conditions that involve lungs / breathing problems should make extra sure they have plenty of all the necessary medication (see Supplies). Make sure you have all the information relevant for treatment (contact info of doctors, recent lab results, how much of which drugs). Assume for a moment that your regular doctor isn't there and you have to explain it all to a new doctor who has very little time. A recent timeline of visits, results, etc would be nice. What should you not forget? Write it down now!

## Level 2 -- Emerging Symptoms
 
* Cough ?
* Fever ?
* Shortness of breath ?

Well, if it appears in the next weeks and months, it could very well be Covid. (But in many areas the odds that it's something else will still be greater for a while.)

### Diagnosis

> Note: Fever is not subjective. You will need a thermometer (or two), and to keep track in a log of at least daily temperature. If you choose to take temperature rectally (more precise), be sure you have enough wipes and alcohol to clean the thermometer after use. If taking temperature orally, don’t eat or drink for 20 minutes beforehand. Either way, note the method in your log so healthcare personnel know which it is. (Around .7 degrees Celsius is often added to oral temperatures.) 

There will be different policies surrounding testing based on where you are and what stage of the pandemic that area is in. Follow official guidelines, and consider driving to a drive-through testing center if your area has one and the patient qualifies for testing. Under no ciscumstances should you show up at a doctor's office or hospital unannounced. Hospitals are bad places to be unless you absolutely have to be there: you and/or the patient run the risk of getting additional infections.

### Don't panic

For most people, this will be as bad as it gets. You'll be sick, and then you'll get better. Done.

### Self-quarantine

Until tested, assume the patient (you? a family member?) has Covid. That means you are now in self-quarantine at home. No more visitors, a sign on the door and the patient should not go out unless there is no chance of meeting anyone. Different areas have different standards for what it means to self-quarantine when there are other people in the household. You will want to err on the side of safety and try to get everything delivered for 2 weeks. Household members should treat themselves as potentially infected and stay at home too, while keeping the maximum practicable distance from the patient while the patient can take care of him- or herself. Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces, and then clean again with water and bleach.

### Diary

It's time to start an illness diary. A few times a day, preferably at regular hours, measure temperature. Weigh the patient once a day if possible. Also note heart rate in beats per minute and respiratory rate (how many breaths per minute). Not necessary, but extra points for blood pressure and SpO2 (see below). Write down what symptoms the patient has. How bad is the cough? What color if there is mucus being produced? And be sure to note what medication, if any, the patient takes. Paracetamol is a good choice for painkilling and fever supression. Keeping an illness diary will also help you to keep track of how much you've taken, when, to ensure you treat fever adequately without taking more than recommended in a day. 

### Get healthy again

Treat fever with over-the-counter medication of your preference (e.g., paracetamol) at the recommended safe dosages; getting in and out of the bath or shower can also help lower body temperature (even when the water temperature is comfortable). Try to keep eating nutritious food. Nothing too heavy, not too much at the same time. Lots of vitamins and fresh produce. Adequate carbohydrates. Inhale steam 3+ times a day. Go for a daily walk when possible, while keeping distance from other people. If your throat is irritated, avoid acidic drinks as they can be further irritating. If your mucus production is high, consider avoiding dairy as it can increase mucus production; avoiding excessive salt and nitrates (in most cold cuts) is also recommended for people with lung disease. Try to suppress cough enough to get a good night's sleep; over-the-counter medications, herbal teas such as anise, cocoa, and lozenges can help. 


### Well again?

Before you break your quarantine, health authorities may want to (re)test you to see you are really not contagious anymore. But maybe the number of cases is already so high that people will have to make their own decisions. Err on the side of safety and try to stay home for a little longer than officially indicated. 

If you managed to get tested, yay! You now know that your body (presumably, keep watching the latest science on this) has built immunity. Which means that this thing is over for you, and also that you are a more logical choice to help your family and friends when they get sick. Depending on what state the world is in, you may want to inform your employer and others that might depend on you that you've had it, so they know you're immune.

## Level 3 -- Bedridden

All the good care in Level 2 has not worked and things are getting worse. Doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just keep going. Except now the patient is getting weaker. He or she is often too weak to get out of bed and may need extra encouragement to eat and drink. 

### If the patient is you

This is when you start telling other people around you that you are really ill and are mostly in bed. Talk to someone you trust about how they may have to take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If you have people in your environment who have already had Covid (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make the best caregivers as they presumably will be Covid-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in your circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because being short of breath can also affect your ability to talk and think clearly.

### In any case

* Stay in bed
* Ventilate the room as often as possible
* Drink more water! (more than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day)
* Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok (need: a couple of tubes of these big fizzy multi-vitamin pills for in a glass of water)
* Inhale more often 

If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day, then you may want to ask if he or she would like to try receiving subcutaneous fluids. Preventing severe dehydration can help prevent 
        
        
        
## Level 4 -- Severe Symptoms

As symptoms get worse and the patient deteriorates, the frequency with which measurements are takes should go up. At this point your log should contain temperature, heart rate and breathing rate at least every couple of hours. Things are getting serious if any of the following things occur:

### Loss of consciousness

There's different levels. When patient loses consciousness, make a note of whether the patient responds when you call their name (Voice), when you pinch the shoulder forcefully (Pain) or whether he/she does not respond at all (Unresponsive)  

### Cognitive problems

There's an Abbreviated mental test score (the AMTS) sometimes used to assess for cognitive problems. Compile the score by asking the following questions, giving one point for each correct answer. A score of less than or equal to 8 suggests cognitive problems may be present. 

- What is your age? 
- What is the time to the nearest hour? 
- (Give the patient an address, and ask him or her to repeat it at the end of the test. For example, 42 Hacker Way.) 
- What year is it? 
- What is the name of the person you are seeing today?
- (Can the patient recognize two persons (e.g., friends or medical practitioners)? 
- What is your date of birth? 
- In what year did World War 2 end? 
- Name the current President/Prime Minister. 
- Count backwards from 10 down to 1.

If the AMTS suggests cognitive problems, this counts as one point in the CRB-65 criteria, a clinical prediction rule used to assess whether patients with pneumonia have such a severe condition that they require in-patient hospital care under normal circumstances. 

Immediate home care for cognitive problems may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink. 

### Too high or too low respiration rate

Count respirations per minute by holding your hand close enough to feel the patient's breath, watching his or her chest, and/or watching his or her abdomen, while holding a clock with a second hand or a digital watch/phone stopwatch. Respiration rate (RR) should be higher than 12 bpm and lower than 27. 30 bpm or higher counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Immediate home care for respiratory problems may include ventilating the patient's room and propping him or her up so that he or she can be in an upright but comfortably resting position. 

### Low oxygen saturation

If you have an oxymeter, oxygen saturation of < 92%  also indicates a likely respiratory problem. 

### Very low blood pressure

Blood pressure lower than the bottom of the normal range (90 mmHg systolic, diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg) counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Dehydration is a common cause of low blood pressure, so immediate home care may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink, especially foods or beverages containing essential electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Dizziness is a common symptom of low blood pressure, so the patient will want to be careful while changing positions (laying to sitting, sitting to standing); syncope (fainting) may occur. 

### Too high or too low heart rate

Heart rate is easier to measure than blood pressure, and usually high heart rate (above 100-110 beats per minute for an adult) goes with low blood pressure. Smaller people and children may have normally higher heart rates. 


### Very high fever that comes (back) suddenly


### Age 65 or older

Age is included in the CRB-65 criteria, and also appears to be a risk factor for more severe COVID manifestations and complications including mortality. The full CRB-65 criteria are as follows: 
- Confusion of new onset (defined as an AMTS of 8 or less)
- Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater
- Blood pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg or less
- Age 65 or older

So if you are compiling a CRB-65 score for the patient to assess severity of pneumonia that would normally be used to determine requirement for hospital care, add a point for age. 


We feel a little worried giving you many hints and tips. In any normal situation, this is not where you should be taking any decisions based on a guide from the internet anymore. Call a doctor. If official means of getting medical help are clogged, try to get hold of that doctor you know, the nurse down the street, anyone with medical training and/or experience. 

Still here? Crap!

Make sure your wider circle know you have a patient who is not doing well and that you cannot get help. Ask around for doctors or nurses. Use Facebook or whatever else you think might help. If you have any spare time after that, organize your patient data, making sure any doctor who has time for the patient can immediately see temperature records, etc. Try not to seem too worried around the patient, because at this point there likely isn't anything he or she is going to be able to do.

same as level 3 plus: ask friends or family for help, tell them to take care about recommendations for level 4 supporters (chapter: nurse), inform doctor / hospital about your situation and give them access to your illness diary 
        
## Level 5 -- Life-Threatening

if possible, go to hospital, if not, ask for level 5 support (chapter: emergency assistance)

- If patient shows signs of dehydration and / or you know he or she has not been drinking enough, give subcutaneous fluids.      
https://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/1101/p1575.html

- If patient's breathing is labored, elevate his or her bed, make a comfortable sitting-up / resting position sofa pillow fort, or see what else you can do with ergonomics to ease breathing problems.
