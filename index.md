This document was made as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but much of the advice may be applicable in other situations. Much of what's discussed here may be common sense to some, but we felt it's still good to have some checklists and advice for various stages of the pandemic in one place. While we consulted with nurses and doctors on much of this advice, most of this text was written by the non-medically trained, trying to puzzle together what makes sense in this new situation. **YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO DOCTORS AND NURSES** when given the choice between that and something you found on the internet.

As we write this in Berlin, Germany in mid-March 2020, much about the virus is still unclear, but numbers of infected and dead have been rising steadily, most recently in Italy. While it is not - ever - time to panic, it is time to think and prepare.

This guide is based on the assumption that in the coming months, more people than usual will either become ill or have ill people in their lives. Let's all hope for the best, but we're going to assume that hospitals are going to be very busy if not overloaded. We have to confront the likelihood that some of the people who would normally be cared for in a medical setting will need to be cared for at home. We hope some of the information here will give you some confidence in dealing with this disease, which in and by itself will reduce the load on doctors and nurses who, from the looks of it, will be quite busy in weeks and months to come.

This guide contains general advice that should be applicable in many places. We may add information that is specific to certain countries or regions, but you should keep your eyes open for more specific information that is more local to where you are.

**WARNING:** *As of March 11, 2020 this website is a work in progress and should at this time only be used as inspiration for further thinking. Things are going to be incomplete or even wrong as we work with experts to make it better.*
