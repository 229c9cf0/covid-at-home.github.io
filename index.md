This document was made as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but much of the advice may be applicable in other situations. Much of what's discussed here may be common sense to some, but we felt it's still good to have some checklists and advice for various stages of the pandemic in one place. While we consulted with nurses and doctors on much of this advice, most of this text was written by the non-medically trained, trying to puzzle together what makes sense in this new situation. **YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS** when given the choice between that and something you found on the internet.

As we write this in Berlin, Germany in mid-March 2020, much about the virus is still unclear, but numbers of infected and dead have been rising steadily, most recently in Italy. While it is not - ever - time to panic, it is time to think and prepare.

This guide is based on the assumption that in the coming months, more people than usual will either become ill or have ill people in their lives. Let's all hope for the best, but we're going to assume that hospitals are going to be very busy if not overloaded. We have to confront the likelihood that some of the people who would normally be cared for in a medical setting will need to be cared for at home. We hope some of the information here will give you some confidence in dealing with this disease, which in and by itself will reduce the load on doctors and nurses who, from the looks of it, will be quite busy in weeks and months to come.

This guide contains general advice that should be applicable in many places. We may add information that is specific to certain countries or regions, but you should keep your eyes open for more specific information that is more local to where you are.

**WARNING:** *As of March 11, 2020 this website is a work in progress and should at this time only be used as inspiration for further thinking. Things are going to be incomplete or even wrong as we work with experts to make it better.*

## Level 3 -- Bedridden

All the good care in Level 2 has not worked and things are getting worse. Doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just keep going. Except now the patient is getting weaker. He or she is often too weak to get out of bed and may need extra encouragement to eat and drink. 

### If the patient is you

This is when you start telling other people around you that you are really ill and are mostly in bed. Talk to someone you trust about how they may have to take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If you have people in your environment who have already had Covid (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make the best caregivers as they presumably will be Covid-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in your circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because being short of breath can also affect your ability to talk and think clearly.

### In any case

* Stay in bed
* Ventilate the room as often as possible
* Drink more water! (more than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day)
* Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok (need: a couple of tubes of these big fizzy multi-vitamin pills for in a glass of water)
* Inhale more often 

If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day, then you may want to ask if he or she would like to try receiving subcutaneous fluids (see below). Preventing severe dehydration can help prevent other complications. Severe dehydration should be treated by medical professionals in a hospital environment. Signs of dehydration include dark or no urine, dizziness and fainting, rapid respiration and heart rate, lack of energy, and changes in mental or emotional state. 
            
        
## Level 4 -- Severe Symptoms

As symptoms get worse and the patient deteriorates, the frequency with which measurements are taken should go up. At this point your log should contain temperature, respiration and heart rate at least every couple of hours. Things are getting serious if any of the following things occur:

### Loss of consciousness

There's different levels. When patient loses consciousness, make a note of whether the patient responds when you call their name (Voice), when you pinch the shoulder forcefully (Pain) or whether he/she does not respond at all (Unresponsive)  

### Cognitive problems

There's an Abbreviated mental test score (the AMTS) sometimes used to assess for cognitive problems. Compile the score by asking the following questions, giving one point for each correct answer. A score of less than or equal to 8 suggests cognitive problems may be present. 

- What is your age? 
- What is the time to the nearest hour? 
- (Give the patient an address, and ask him or her to repeat it at the end of the test. For example, 42 Hacker Way.) 
- What year is it? 
- What is the name of the person you are seeing today?
- (Can the patient recognize two persons (e.g., friends or medical practitioners)? 
- What is your date of birth? 
- In what year did World War 2 end? 
- Name the current President/Prime Minister. 
- Count backwards from 10 down to 1.

If the AMTS suggests cognitive problems, this counts as one point in the CRB-65 criteria, a clinical prediction rule used to assess whether patients with pneumonia have such a severe condition that they require in-patient hospital care under normal circumstances. 

Immediate home care for cognitive problems may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink. 

### Too high or too low respiration rate

Count respirations per minute by holding your hand close enough to feel the patient's breath, watching his or her chest, and/or watching his or her abdomen, while holding a clock with a second hand or a digital watch/phone stopwatch. Respiration rate (RR) should be higher than 12 bpm and lower than 27. 30 bpm or higher counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Immediate home care for respiratory problems may include ventilating the patient's room and propping him or her up so that he or she can be in an upright but comfortably resting position. 

### Low oxygen saturation

If you have an oxymeter, oxygen saturation of < 92%  also indicates a likely respiratory problem. 

### Very low blood pressure

Blood pressure lower than the bottom of the normal range (90 mmHg systolic, diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg) counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Dehydration is a common cause of low blood pressure, so immediate home care may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink, especially foods or beverages containing essential electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Dizziness is a common symptom of low blood pressure, so the patient will want to be careful while changing positions (laying to sitting, sitting to standing); syncope (fainting) may occur. 

### Too high or too low heart rate

Heart rate is easier to measure than blood pressure, and usually high heart rate (above 100-110 beats per minute for an adult) goes with low blood pressure. Smaller people and children may have normally higher heart rates. 


### Very high fever that comes (back) suddenly


### Age 65 or older

Age is included in the CRB-65 criteria, and also appears to be a risk factor for more severe COVID manifestations and complications including mortality. The full CRB-65 criteria are as follows: 
- Confusion of new onset (defined as an AMTS of 8 or less)
- Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater
- Blood pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg or less
- Age 65 or older

So if you are compiling a CRB-65 score for the patient to assess severity of pneumonia that would normally be used to determine requirement for hospital care, add a point for age. 


We feel a little worried giving you many hints and tips. In any normal situation, this is not where you should be taking any decisions based on a guide from the internet anymore. Call a doctor. If official means of getting medical help are clogged, try to get hold of that doctor you know, the nurse down the street, anyone with medical training and/or experience. 

Still here? Crap!

Make sure your wider circle know you have a patient who is not doing well and that you cannot get help. Ask around for doctors or nurses. Use Facebook or whatever else you think might help. If you have any spare time after that, organize your patient data, making sure any doctor who has time for the patient can immediately see temperature records, etc. Try not to seem too worried around the patient, because at this point there likely isn't anything he or she is going to be able to do.

same as level 3 plus: ask friends or family for help, tell them to take care about recommendations for level 4 supporters (chapter: nurse), inform doctor / hospital about your situation and give them access to your illness diary 
        
## Level 5 -- Life-Threatening

if possible, go to hospital, if not, ask for level 5 support (chapter: emergency assistance)

- If patient shows signs of dehydration and / or you know he or she has not been drinking enough and is not able to remedy that, ask if he or she would like to receive subcutaneous fluids. We will update this chapter in days to come. For now, it seems likely that you can still take the patient to a hospital, where he or she can receive appropriate medical care including emergency rehydration from trained professionals.      

- If patient's breathing is labored, elevate his or her bed, make a comfortable sitting-up / resting position sofa pillow fort, or see what else you can do with ergonomics to ease breathing problems.
