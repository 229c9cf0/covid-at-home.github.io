## Level 5 -- Life-Threatening

This section will at some point in the next weeks and months possibly contain tips for when you know the patient is in very bad shape, but are unable to get timely help. At this point we feel it may not be appropriate to put much here as this situation is not yet happening and we do not want people playing doctor when there's real medical help available.

If your loved one is in bad shape - and we've tried to give you some tools to figure out if they are - call your local emergency number and get the patient in an ambulance. Stay calm and report the situation as it is. Your job is done: you have kept a patient out of the medical system until the situation got too bad for non-professionals to handle. The data you have been gathering should hopefully help you convince the operator that you are not merely panicking for no reason and will help get the patient the care he/she needs sooner.

For now let's all hope our medical professionals can cope with the case load that is coming to them.
