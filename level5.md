## Level 5 -- Life-Threatening

if possible, go to hospital, if not, ask for level 5 support (chapter: emergency assistance)

- If patient shows signs of dehydration and / or you know he or she has not been drinking enough and is not able to remedy that, ask if he or she would like to receive subcutaneous fluids. We will update this chapter in days to come. For now, it seems likely that you can still take the patient to a hospital, where he or she can receive appropriate medical care including emergency rehydration from trained professionals.      

- If patient's breathing is labored, elevate his or her bed, make a comfortable sitting-up / resting position sofa pillow fort, or see what else you can do with ergonomics to ease breathing problems.
