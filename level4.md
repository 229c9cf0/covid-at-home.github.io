## Level 4 -- Severe Symptoms

As symptoms get worse and the patient deteriorates, the frequency with which measurements are taken should go up. At this point, your log should contain temperature, respiration, and heart rate every few hours. Things are getting serious if any of the following occurs:

### Loss of consciousness

There's different levels. When patient loses consciousness, make a note of whether the patient responds when you call their name (Voice), when you pinch the shoulder forcefully (Pain) or whether he/she does not respond at all (Unresponsive)  

### Cognitive problems

There's an Abbreviated mental test score (the AMTS) sometimes used to assess for cognitive problems. Compile the score by asking the following questions, giving one point for each correct answer. A score of less than or equal to 8 suggests cognitive problems may be present. 

- What is your age? 
- What is the time to the nearest hour? 
- (Give the patient an address, and ask him or her to repeat it at the end of the test. For example, 42 Hacker Way.) 
- What year is it? 
- What is the name of the person you are seeing today?
- (Can the patient recognize two persons (e.g., friends or medical practitioners)?) 
- What is your date of birth? 
- In what year did World War 2 end? 
- Name the current President/Prime Minister. 
- Count backwards from 10 down to 1.

If the AMTS suggests cognitive problems, this counts as one point in the CRB-65 criteria, a clinical prediction rule used to assess whether patients with pneumonia have such a severe condition that they would require out-patient or in-patient hospital care under normal circumstances. 

Immediate home care for cognitive problems may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink, being sure appropriate fever medication has been taken on schedule, and freshly ventilating the room. 

### Too high or too low respiration rate

Count respirations per minute by holding your hand close enough to feel the patient's breath, watching his or her chest, and/or watching his or her abdomen, while holding a clock with a second hand or a digital watch/phone stopwatch. Respiration rate (RR) should be higher than 12 bpm and lower than 27. A respiratory rate of 30+ bpm counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Immediate home care for respiratory problems may include ventilating the patient's room and propping him or her up so that he or she can be in an upright but comfortably resting position. It is also a good idea to elevate the head of the bed for sleeping if possible, and there are some sleeping positions that can make breathing easier, too. 

### Low oxygen saturation

If you have an oxymeter, oxygen saturation of < 92%  also indicates a likely respiratory problem. 

### Very low blood pressure

Blood pressure lower than the bottom of the normal range (90 mmHg systolic, 60 mmHg diastolic) counts as a point in the CRB-65 criteria. 

Dehydration is a common cause of low blood pressure, so immediate home care may include encouraging the patient to eat and drink, especially foods or beverages containing essential electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Dizziness is a common symptom of low blood pressure, so the dizzy patient will want to be careful while changing positions (laying to sitting up, sitting to standing); syncope (fainting) may occur. 

### Too high or too low heart rate

Heart rate is easier to measure than blood pressure, and usually high heart rate (above 100-110 beats per minute for an adult) goes with low blood pressure. Smaller people and children often have normally higher heart rates. 


### Very high fever that comes (back) suddenly


### Age 65 or older

Age is included in the CRB-65 criteria, and also appears to be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 manifestations and complications including mortality. The full CRB-65 criteria are as follows: 
- Confusion of new onset (defined as an AMTS of 8 or less)
- Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater
- Blood pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg or less
- Age 65+

So if you are compiling a CRB-65 score for the patient to assess severity of pneumonia that would normally be used to determine requirement for hospital care, add a point for age. 


### Serious medical situations

We feel a little worried giving you many hints and tips. In any normal situation, this is not where you should be taking any decisions based on a guide from the internet anymore. Call a doctor. If official means of getting medical help are clogged, try to get hold of that doctor you know, the nurse down the street, anyone with medical training and/or experience. 

Still here? Crap!

Make sure your wider circle know you have a patient who is not doing well and that you cannot get help. Ask around for doctors or nurses. Use Facebook or whatever else you think might help. If you have any spare time after that, organize your patient data, making sure any doctor who has time for the patient can immediately see temperature records, etc. Try not to seem too worried around the patient, because at this point there likely isn't anything he or she is going to be able to do.

Same as Level 3 plus: Ask friends or family for help, tell them to take care about recommendations for Level 4 supporters, inform doctor / hospital about your situation and give them access to your illness diary. At this point it might include a CRB-65 assessment score that can help them speed up triage. Anything you can do to help them assess the situation quickly wil probably be appreciated when the system is overloaded.
