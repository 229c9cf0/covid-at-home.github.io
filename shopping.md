   > So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted anally, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   > Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: once people get sick you want to change the bedlinens often, and you may use more towels also
   
* **Cleaning supplies, bleach**


## Nice to have

* Pulse oxymeter (10-20 EUR/USD). 

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))

   > 
   > There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However it doesn't hurt to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to see/show a trend in the patient's blood pressure.

* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))

   > Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us.
