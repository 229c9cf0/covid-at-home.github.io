## Shopping list

Here are some necessary and handy things to have if you are going to be taking care of someone with COVID-19. None of this is very expensive. If we included examples (on the German version of Amazon) this is not a buying recommendation, we are not making any money if you click that precise one (or another), and by showing you the example we mean "use your local version or whatever other online or retail channel to get something similar". 

&nbsp;

### Must have

* **Fever thermometer** (2-10 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001NYHXYS))

   > ![](/images/thermometer.png)
   > 
   > So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted anally to get a more precise measurement, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   > Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: once people get sick you want to change the bed linens often, and you may use more towels also.
   
* **Cleaning supplies, bleach**

* **Paracetamol**

  > The painkiller and fever supressant of choice. Unless you are allergic to it, in which case ibuprofen may be the next best thing. Make sure you follow the packing slip instructions and do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose.

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

Shopping for PPE is a lttle tricky because early on in the pandemic people were panic-buying masks, making them unavailable in some regions to medical personnel who really needed them. If it's still early in the pandemic, your government will probably be providing masks to people who live with and/or care for people with COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get if you need to be caring for other people. Please listen to official advice on what **not** to buy so as to not make things unavailable to the doctors and nurses who need them the most. 

* **Medical mask, preferably N95** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085H6Y6HN))
   > ![](/images/mask.png)
   > 
   > FFP2 or FFP3 respirators (valved or non-valved versions) are also recommended. A regular face mask (surgical or procedural) is better than nothing if you cannot get a respirator.

* **Gown / raincoat** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFDFFRX))

   > Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown. 

* **Gloves** (less than a EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7))
   > ![](/images/gloves.png)

* **Eye protection, goggles or face shield** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002THV25Y))
   > ![](/images/glasses.png)
   >

### Nice to have

* **Pulse oxymeter** (20-25 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P3ZS6L3))
   > ![](/images/pulse-oxi.png)
   >
   > Little gadget that clips on your finger and shows the heart rate (which is also easy to measure in other ways) and the oxygen saturation in the blood (which is hard to measure any other way).

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))
   > ![](/images/blood-pressure.png)
   > 
   > There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However, it doesn't hurt to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to see/show a trend in the patient's blood pressure.

* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))
   > ![](/images/sheet.png)
   >
   > Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us.

* **Steam inhaler** (25 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SNQH6CZ))
   > ![](/images/steam.png)
   >
   > Often sold as "face sauna" or whatever other names, they're just devices that output steam that is not too hot to breathe. Any other method that produces steam is also OK, just make sure you don't do damage with steam that's too hot. The device takes demineralized water ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J5Y95MQ), esp. in places where the tapwater is high in calcium. 

* **Vitamins** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07S63PCZK))
   > ![](/images/multi-vitamin.png)
   >
   > For when the patient doesn't eat (much) anymore but still drinks. Maybe take the big multi-vitamin pills that fizz into water, a couple of tubes of those. Try getting ones that contain roughly 1-2 times the daily recommended dose of all the vitamins and minerals they contain, no crazy 1000% megadoses.
