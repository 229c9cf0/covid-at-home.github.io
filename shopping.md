## Shopping list

Here are some necessary and handy things to have if you are going to be taking care of someone with Covid-19. None of this is very expensive. If we included examples (on the German version of Amazon) this is not a buying recommendation, we are not making any money if you cllick that precise one, and by showing you the example we mean "use your local version or whatever other online or retail channel to get something similar".) 

&nbsp;

### Must have

* **Fever thermometer** (2-10 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001NYHXYS))

   > ![](/images/thermometer.png)
   > 
   > So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted anally, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   > Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: once people get sick you want to change the bedlinens often, and you may use more towels also.
   
* **Cleaning supplies, bleach**

* **paracetamol**

  > The painkiller and fever supressant of choice. Unless you are allergic to it, in which case Ibuprofen may be the next best thing. Make sure you follow the packing slip instructions as to how much to maximally take per day.

### Nice to have

* **Pulse oxymeter** (20-25 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P3ZS6L3))
   > ![](/images/pulse-oxi.png)
   >
   > Little gadget that clips on your finger and shows the heart rate (which is easy to measure other ways) and the oxygen saturation in the blood (which is harder to measure any other way).

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))
   > ![](/images/blood-pressure.png)
   > 
   > There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However it doesn't hurt to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to see/show a trend in the patient's blood pressure.

* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))
   > ![](/images/sheet.png)
   >
   > Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us.

* **Vitamins** (a few EUR/USD)
   > ![](/images/multi-vitamin.png) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07S63PCZK))
   >
   > For when the patient doesn't eat (much) anymore but still drinks. Maybe take the big multi-vitamin pills that fizz into water, a couple of tubes of those. Try getting ones that contain roughly 1-2 times the daily recommended dose of all the vitamins and minerals they contain, no crazy 1000% megadoses.
